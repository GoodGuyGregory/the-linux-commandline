### Install Docker Desktop:

Leverage Homebrew to install Docker Desktop

`brew install --cask docker`

### Pull the Latest Linux Flavor:

choose your distribution of linux you want to work with, I recommend leveraging `ubuntu`, **start Docker Desktop** then run the following after making your choice

`docker pull ubuntu`

### Run the Container:

Run the docker container in interactive mode with the `-it` flag, along with your linux flavor of choice.

`docker run -it ubuntu`
